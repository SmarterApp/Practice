# Practice
A repository where people can practice posting issues, adding and synchronizing content, and so forth. Professional conduct is expected even though this is not a real project.

# Standards of Behavior
As an open source project, the SmarterApp issues repository is open to public view. This is an important principle of open source development followed by nearly every successful open source project. Because the information is public, Smarter Balanced expects a high standard of conduct. Contributors should not be shy about reporting issues, but all descriptions should be accurate and professional with a focus on the software and the issue at hand. Contributors should use appropriate professional language and should refrain from derogatory comments or ad hominem attacks.

Smarter Balanced moderates SmarterApp.org and will remove content that doesn't meet these standards or that may cause offense.
